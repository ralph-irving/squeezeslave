[[SqueezeSlave]] is a software music player that allows you to play music streamed from [[SqueezeCenter]] (formerly known as [[SlimServer]]) and [[SqueezeNetwork]].

[[SqueezeSlave]] is an alternative to [[SoftSqueeze]].  The main difference is that SqueezeSlave has no graphical interface (GUI), but rather is run from a command line.  This makes SqueezeSlave useful as a player for "headless" applications (e.g., server computer without display).  It's also useful as a background player where a display is not required, or as a player which uses the least computing resources.

[[SqueezeSlave]] was written by Richard Titmuss with contributions from Duane Paddock, Dominique Leroux, Graham Chapman, Ivor Bosloper Jason Melvin, Sam Gupta and Luke Redpath.

[[SqueezeSlave]] is currently maintained by Ralph Irving http://forums.slimdevices.com/member.php?u=3484.

Executable versions for Windows, Linux, OSX and Solaris SPARC/Intel can be downloaded from SourceForge.net at: https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=105169&package_id=176494

The linux version as of January 18, 2009 supports alsa, IR remotes, USB displays and an on screen text mode display.
The additional display features requires the Squeezecenter patch: squeezecenter_squeezeslave_player2-7.3.patch which is available at the SourceForge.net link above.  This patch supercedes squeezecenter_var_size_display.patch and has been submitted as http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=11330 for inclusion in SqueezeCenter.

:::                            For 16-bit sources, the max is 32767, but values
:::                            below 10 are likely to work.  The goal is to
:::                            produce an inaudible signal that will cause DACs
:::                            to wake-up and lock before actual samples are

::-k, --keepalive <sec>:      Controls how frequently squeezeslave sends a

:::                            need this to avoid dropping the player's

:::                            chooses the right value: 10s for a >=6.5.x server

::-L, --list                  List available audio devices and exit.
::-m, --mac <mac_address>:    Sets the mac address for this instance.
:::                            Use the colon-separated notation.
:::                            The default is 00:00:00:00:00:01.

::-p, --predelay <msec>:      Sets a delay before any playback is started.  This
:::                            is useful if the DAC used for output is slow to

:::                            attempts.
::-r <sec>                    For a different retry interval use -r and the

:::                            A value is required for this option.
::-s, --signal:               Ignored. Always uses SIGTERM to exit.
