[b]What's new in Squeezeslave 1.0-210[/b]

Windows 7/Vista WASAPI Exclusive and Shared mode version.
Default is Exclusive mode.
Add -S/--shared option to the command line to enable sharing the audio device.
Settings in Control Panel for the shared device MUST be set to 16-bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality).
Note:  Changing audio settings in Control Panel silences audio until Squeezeslave is restarted.  A known issue with the audio support library, no fix is currently available.

Removed the pthreadGC2.dll dependency for Windows.

Added option to increase the process priority class to high for windows using -H/--highpriority command line option.

Mac OSX 10.5/10.6 64-bit Intel version is now included in the Mac download package.

Added workaround for unavailable keys Insert, Home and End with an Apple keyboard in OSX terminal interactive mode.

Added portaudio hostapi name and low/high latency info to output device listing.

Added -y/--latency command line option to allow tuning the audio buffers to prevent audio dropouts or "skipping".
This issue is mainly seen on Linux systems and I have found the following values eliminates the dropouts.
For Linux 2.6 kernels add -y84 or  2.4 add -y140 to the command line.
This increases the CPU utilization of squeezeslave, while streaming.
These are the recommended starting values but can be increased by even values if dropouts are still heard.
Only available on squeezeslave versions with the compile flag portaudio:1541.
To check if your version has this option run squeezeslave with the -V/--version option.

Short first tracks preventing advance to the next track in the playlist has been fixed.  LastFM and Napster now change to the next track as well.

OGG stream positioning no longer fails when clicking the time bar in the server default skin web interface.

Upgraded libogg to v1.2.0.

Upgraded libvorbis to v1.3.1.

Upgraded libportaudio to PADEV r1541.

You can interact with squeezeslave via the keyboard and control the player like the slimp3, sb2/3 and boom hardware players on all platforms.  Note that bit mapped graphics are not available, only text characters can be displayed.  Requires SBS v7.4 r26720+.  7.2/7.3 server patches are supplied in the binary package files.  See -D and -w options for usage details.

The screen shot above is an 80x4 Windows command prompt running squeezeslave with these parameters.

[b]Bug Fixes[/b]
Fixed datarace in slimaudio_buffer_set_readopt and slimaudio_buffer_available functions.
Fixed PA audio callback blocking when in output buffer underrun situation.
Fixed unlocking of buffer_mutex before data_len update.
Fixed buffer_read remaining blocked after the buffer has been closed.
Fixed ogg decoder handling for ov_read returning OV_HOLE.

[b]Known Problems[/b]
Squeezeslave will not work with the Spotify Plugin as direct streaming is not supported.

OSX systems can take up to 20 seconds to enter sleep mode when running squeezeslave under launchctl.

If squeezeslave is playing when sleep mode is activated, no audio will be heard after system resume. Stop and restart the player from the classic web gui to restore audio.  Alternatively, STOP the player not PAUSE before placing the computer into sleep state.  This can be accomplished by holding the space bar in interactive mode until the player displays "stopping" in the display. There is also a "stop" button in the classic web gui.

LIRC and LCDd features are NOT available in the windows version.
