[[Category: Software players]]

[[SqueezeSlave]] is a software music player that allows you to play music streamed from [[SqueezeCenter | Squeezebox Server]] (formerly known as [[SqueezeCenter]], [[SlimServer]]) and [[SqueezeNetwork]].

[[SqueezeSlave]] is an alternative to [[SoftSqueeze]].  The main difference is that SqueezeSlave has no graphical interface (GUI), but rather is run from a command line.  This makes SqueezeSlave useful as a player for "headless" applications (e.g., server computer without display).  It's also useful as a background player where a display is not required, or as a player which uses the least computing resources.

[[SqueezeSlave]] was written by Richard Titmuss with contributions from Duane Paddock, Dominique Leroux, Graham Chapman, Ivor Bosloper, Jason Melvin, Sam Gupta and Luke Redpath.

[[SqueezeSlave]] is currently maintained by Ralph Irving http://forums.slimdevices.com/member.php?u=3484.

If you have problems with [[SqueezeSlave]] read the support thread at http://forums.slimdevices.com/showthread.php?t=63966 for additional help.

Executable versions for Windows, Linux PPC/Intel, OSX PPC/Intel and Solaris SPARC/Intel can be downloaded from SourceForge.net at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/softsqueeze/files/squeezeslave/squeezeslave-0.9.95/

The linux version supports ALSA, pulseaudio, OSS, IR remotes, USB displays and an on screen text mode display.
The additional display features no longer require patching for [[SqueezeCenter | Squeezebox Server]] v7.4 r26720 or later.
For older versions of [[SqueezeCenter]] the replay gain patches below include the necessary changes for the display feature.

Version 0.9 brings replay gain support with [[SqueezeCenter | Squeezebox Server]] v7.4 r26720 or later.
Positive dB replay gain values are ignored to prevent clipping.

Patch files squeezecenter_squeezeslave_player3-7.3.patch and squeezecenter_squeezeslave_player3-7.2.patch are included in the binary packages if that build has the features enabled for squeezecenter 7.3.3 and 7.2.2 running on linux/solaris.  They are also available in the source tree under the patches subdirectory.


== Installation ==

=== Mac OS X installation ===

The Mac OS X version can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/softsqueeze/files/squeezeslave/squeezeslave-0.9.95/squeezeslave-0.9-95-osx.tar.gz/download . Unpacking the file gives a folder with
* A GNU <code>LICENSE.txt</code>
* An <code>squeezeslave-ppc</code> and
* a <code>squeezeslave-intel</code> executable.
* A launchd <code>squeezeslave.plist</code> description file
* There are several other squeezeslave binaries included but are not needed unless you run into problems.

A look at the <code>plist</code> file indicates that the executable is to be renamed and moved to <code>/opt/local/bin/</code>.
You might have to create the corresponding directory.

Time to open the '''Terminal''' as an administrator, navigate to the place the downloaded files are located and

 mkdir -p /opt/local/bin/
 mv squeezeslave-intel /opt/local/bin/squeezeslave

You can now check the command line options with 
 /opt/local/bin/squeezeslave -h

The next step is to find out which number is associated to the output device you plan to use 
 /opt/local/bin/squeezeslave -L

which gave me
 Output devices:
   0: iSight
   1: Built-in Line Input
   2: Built-in Digital Input
   3: Built-in Output
   4: Built-in Line Output
   5: Built-in Digital Output

Now try to run it.
If your Squeezecenter runs on the same machine and you want to send the audio to the line output
 /opt/local/bin/squeezeslave -o4
If the Squeezecenter runs on another machine, add its host name to the command line
 /opt/local/bin/squeezeslave -o4 macmini.mynet

Now open the SqueezeCenter control webpage and look at the players list. The new Squeezeslave should have appeared.

If this works, you are ready to have Squeezeslave automatically launched at boot time.

Lingon http://sourceforge.net/projects/lingon/ provides a gui to edit and create launchd configuration files or you can edit <code>squeezeslave.plist</code> with a text editor and customize it to your installation.
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
 <plist version="1.0">
 	<dict>
 		<key>KeepAlive</key>
 		<true/>
 		<key>OnDemand</key>
 		<false/>
 		<key>RunAtLoad</key>
 		<true/>
 		<key>Label</key>
 		<string>squeezeslave</string>
 		<key>ProgramArguments</key>
 		<array>
 			<string>/opt/local/bin/squeezeslave</string>
 			<string>-o4</string>
 			<string>-r10</string>
 			<string>macmini.mynet</string>
 		</array>
 	</dict>
 </plist>

If you intend to use more than one Squeezeslave, you will need to provide a different mac address to each
 		<array>
 			<string>/opt/local/bin/squeezeslave</string>
 			<string>-o4</string>
 			<string>-r10</string>
 			<string>-m00:00:00:00:00:16</string>
 			<string>macmini.mynet</string>
 		</array>

For me, the lengthier command parameter <code>--mac 00:00:00:00:00:16</code> didn't work properly.

Move the file to the proper place
 mv squeezeslave.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
 chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/squeezeslave.plist

Start Squeezeslave
 launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/squeezeslave.plist

Check it is running
 ps ax | grep squeeze

Stop it
 launchctl remove squeezelave

The Squeezeslave should now automatically launch at login time.

=== Linux build instructions ===
Prebuilt versions of squeezeslave for most platforms are available on SourceForge.net.  However, if you have problems with the precompiled binaries for linux, please checkout the source and build yourself. There have been many issues lately with system libraries and the linux binaries that have been solved by building your own.

The current source tree for squeezeslave is available on Google Code.

The current and all previous 0.8 releases are available for checkout.

 svn checkout http://squeezeslave.googlecode.com/svn/squeezeslave/trunk/squeezeslave

The makefiles build all required support libraries; portaudio, flac, ogg, vorbis and mad.

System libraries are still required for alsa (asound), curses (ncurses) and lirc_client and may require installing the "development" packages to compile successfully.

On ubuntu linux the following commands run as root will install the additional requirements.

 sudo apt-get install subversion

 sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev

and these additional packages are only required to build the INTERACTIVE version, makefiles with "display" in the filename.  The INTERACTIVE (display) adds support for a text console display, much like the [[SliMP3]] player and the ability to control the display using the keyboard.  USB LCD displays and IR remotes can also be used with the display version.

 sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

 sudo apt-get install liblircclient-dev

===Which makefile does what?===

Most current linux distributions are based on the Linux 2.6 kernel so these makefiles should work for most current linux installs.

*Linux 2.6 32-bit intel kernel, OSS, ALSA and pulseaudio audio drivers.

makefile.linux26-alsa

makefile.linux26-alsa-display

*Linux 2.6 64-bit intel kernel, OSS, ALSA and pulseaudio audio drivers.

makefile.linux26-i64-alsa

makefile.linux26-i64-alsa-display

*Linux 2.6 32-bit PowerPC kernel (PS3, PPC Mac), OSS, ALSA and pulseaudio audio drivers

makefile.linux26-ppc-alsa

makefile.linux26-ppc-alsa-display

===A typical build===

 svn checkout http://squeezeslave.googlecode.com/svn/squeezeslave/trunk/squeezeslave
 cd squeezeslave
 make -f makefile.linux26-alsa realclean
 make -f makefile.linux26-alsa

Upon successfull completion, you'll find a file in the bin/ directory starting with squeezeslave.  Several makefiles append additional words to help identify the "flavour" of the build for packaging purposes.  You can safely rename the file to be called just squeezeslave.  This step is NOT necessary with the above build example.

 cd bin; mv squeezeslave-alsa squeezeslave

=== FreeBSD build instructions ===

You need the following ports packages: audio/libogg, audio/libvorbis, audio/libmad, audio/flac, audio/portaudio2 and optionaly comms/lirc.

If you don't want lirc, you need to remove '-DINTERACTIVE' from makefile (line 7).

Then, type:

 make -f makefile.freebsd

=== NetBSD build instructions ===

You need the following pkgsrc packages: multimedia/libogg, audio/libvorbis, audio/libmad, audio/flac and audio/portaudio-devel.

Then use the following makefile [[http://www.baaz.fr/makefile.netbsd]].

and:

 make -f makefile.netbsd

This makefile doesn't build squeezeslave with INTERACTIVE (lirc and screen). This should work (you need to install wip/lirc) but I didn't test.

=== Windows build instructions ===

Download Cygwin setup from http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe

Setup.exe version 2.674 was used for this install.

Root Directory: C:\cygwin<br />
All Users (Recommended)<br />
Local Package Directory C:\cygwin\pkgs<br />

If you'd like to be able to ssh to your windows machine, instructions on setting up cygwin sshd can be found at http://pigtail.net/LRP/printsrv/cygwin-sshd.html  This step is not required to build squeezeslave.

To build an ASIO binary you need to obtain Steinberg's ASIO SDK asiosdk2.2.zip file from http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/3rd_party_developer/sdk_download_portal.html as it cannot be included in the repository.  Registration is required.  The ASIO SDK is not needed for the DirectX build.

You'll need to download the DirectX SDK file DXSDK_Mar09.exe or older from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=24A541D6-0486-4453-8641-1EEE9E21B282&displaylang=en as it's not included in the repository.  The currently available DXSDK_Aug09.exe does NOT compile with squeezeslave.  If the version of the SDK you're using is not DXSDK_Mar09.exe you'll need to update the filename in the makefile as well.  The DirectX SDK is not needed for the ASIO build.

Launch a 'Cygwin Bash Shell" command prompt window.  The icon should be on your Desktop.

 svn checkout http://squeezeslave.googlecode.com/svn/squeezeslave/trunk/squeezeslave
 cd squeezeslave

 <i>Direct sound build</i>
 <i>Copy DXSDK_Mar09.exe file into the sources subdirectory using Windows explorer.</i>
 make -f makefile.mingw32 realclean
 make -f makefile.mingw32

 <i>ASIO build</i>
 <i>Copy asiosdk2.2.zip file into the sources subdirectory using Windows explorer.</i>
 make -f makefile.mingw32-asio realclean
 make -f makefile.mingw32-asio

Upon successfull completion, you'll find a file in the bin/ directory called squeezeslave.exe.  Several makefiles append a hyphen and an additional word to help identify the "flavour" of the build for packaging purposes.
